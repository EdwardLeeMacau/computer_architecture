# Computer Architecture 2022 Fall Midterm Exam

1. We would like to parallelize a program on a two-core processor. The workload of the target program is evenly partitioned between these two cores. Let's assume when running the parallelized version, each core runs at 70% of the voltage and frequency of the settings of a serial version. Due to the synchronization overhead between two threads, the execution time of each thread increases 10% compared to the serial version. What is the energy saving we can get from parallelizing the target program on a two-core processor?

    $$
    \begin{align*}
    E  &=          && 1.0 \times \text{CL} \times &&&              V^2 \times F \\
    E' &= 2 \times && 1.1 \times \text{CL} \times &&& 0.7^3 \times V^2 \times F \\
    \text{Ratio} &= 2 \times && 1.1 \times 0.7^3
    \end{align*}
    $$

2. Suppose a program runs in 150 seconds on a computer, with multiply operations responsible for 100 seconds of the total execution time. Is it possible to execute the program 4 times faster by improving the speed of multiplication? Please explain your answer.

    It is impossible, because the program execution time can be improved to at most 3 times faster (150 seconds to 50 seconds) by improving the speed of multiplication to no-time-cost operations.

3. You are asked to design a single-cycle processor to accelerate a workload which spends 40% of time in function `f()`. Each function `f()` executes 20 dynamic instructions. One possible design is to add a new instruction that could perform function `f()` in one cycle. But adding this new instruction would double the cycle time. Is this a good solution? Please explain your answer.

    The new design increases the execution time. Because the program spends 60% times for other calculations, doubling the cycle time leads 60% $\times$ 2 = 120% times for those calculation, which is bad for overall execution time reduction.

4. Compilers can have a profound impact on the performance of an application on a given processor. This problem will explore the impact compilers have on execution time. (Please round all answer to the 2nd decimal place)

    |    Compiler A     |                |    Compiler B     |                |
    | :---------------: | :------------: | :---------------: | :------------: |
    | Instruction count | Execution Time | Instruction count | Execution Time |
    |      1.70E+9      |      3.4s      |      1.70E+9      |     4.08s      |

    4.1 Find the average CPI for each program given that the processor has a clock cycle time of 2ns.

    $$
    \text{CPI}_\text{avg} = \dfrac{T \cdot F}{\text{IC}}
    $$

    $$
    \text{CPI}^A_\text{avg} = \dfrac{3.4 \times 0.5 \times 10^9}{1.70 \times 10^9} = 1.00
    $$

    $$
    \text{CPI}^B_\text{avg} = \dfrac{4.08 \times 0.5 \times 10^9}{1.70 \times 10^9} = 1.20
    $$

    4.2 Assume the average CPIs found in (1), but that the compiled programs run on two different processors. If the execution times on the two processors are the same, how much faster is the clock of the processor running compile A's code versus the clock of the processor running compiler B's code.

    4.3 A new compiler is developed that uses only 1.40E+9 instructions and has an average CPI of 1.4. What is the speed-up of using this new compiler versus using Compiler A or B on the original processor of (1)?

    $$
    T' = \dfrac{\text{IC} \cdot \text{CPI}_\text{avg}}{F} = \dfrac{1.4 \times 10^9 \times 1.4}{0.5 \times 10^9} = 3.92 (\text{s})
    $$

5. Registers are usually used to hold temporaries. Ideally, the more registers, the more objects could be allocated to registers, and memory references to those objects could be saved. Assume that we would like to expand the RISC-V (32-bit instruction/32 registers) register file to 64 registers. Please answer the following questions.

    5.1 What is the total number of bits needed for a R-type format instruction?

    R-type has 17-bits for specifying operation, 3x5-bits for addressing (rs1, rs2, rd). Assume that we expand the instruction by only changing rs1, rs2, and rd. Total 35-bits are needed for a R-type format instruction.

    5.2 How would the proposed change affect that size of a RISC-V assembly program?

    Assume that the CPU always fetches the instructions in unaligned access mode, we can use 40 bytes to store an instruction. Thus the program size is increased by 25% under the assumption.

    On the other hand, if we store the instructions in aligned access mode, we must use 64 bytes, which means the program size is doubled in this case.

6. The pseudo instruction is an instruction that will be mapped to a sequence of real instructions by the assembler. For instance, `la rd, symbol` (load the address of `symbol` to `rd`) will be mapped to two instructions:

    ```asm
    auipc   rd, delta[31:12] + delta[11]
    addi    rd, rd, delta[11:0]
    ```

    For example, assuming that the address of the `la` instruction is 0x2000 and the address of `symbol` is 0x3000, the assembler calculates 0x3000 - 0x2000 = 0x1000 as `delta` which is then used to construct the `auipc` and `addi` instructions.

    `auipc` (add upper immediate to PC) is used to build PC-relative addresses and uses the U-type format. `auipc` forms a 32-bit offset from the 20-bit U-immediate, filling in the lowest 12 bits with zeros, adds this offset to the address of the `auipc` instruction, then places the result in register `rd`.

   6.1 What is the advantage of having pseudo instruction?

   Pseudo instructions encodes To help programmer writing less code during development.

   6.2 In the above example, the la instruction is translated into two instructions. Why does the first instruction need to add delta[11] to the upper twenty bits of delta? Please explain what would happen if we replace `auipc rd, delta[31:12] + delta[11]` with `auipc rd, delta[31:12]`?

    If the 11-th bit of delta is 1, then during the second instruction, we will do a signed extension to delta[11:0] before adding it, so if delta[11] is one, then we have added 1...(20 one's)...10...(12 zeros)..0 to the result, so by adding 10...(12 zeros)...0, we would cancel this effect.

7. Translate the following C code to 64-bit RISC-V assembly code. Use a minimum number of instructions. Assume that the C-level integer variable `i` and `a` are held in x5 and x6, respectively. And x17, x18, x19 hold the base address of the `long` type array `A`, `B`, and `C`, respectively. (Assume the size of a long type variable in C code is 8 bytes.)

    ```c
    int i, a;
    for (i = 0; i < a; i++) {
        C[i] = A[i] + B[4] + i;
    }
    ```

    ```asm
    function:
        addi x5, x0, 0          // int i = 0;
    loop:
        bge x5, x6, end         // if (i >= a) { goto end; }
        ld x28, 0(x17)          // load A[i] to register
        ld x29, 32(x18)         // load B[4] to register
        add x30, x28, x29
        add x30, x30, x5        // calculate A[i] + B[4] + i
        sd x30, 0(x19)          // store to C[i]
        addi x17, x17, 8        // A => move to next element
        addi x19, x19, 8        // C => move to next element
        addi x5, x5, 1          // i = i + 1
        jmp loop
    end:
        nop
    ```

8. Most ISAs have separate register files: general purpose registers and floating point registers. Why do most modern ISAs provide different sets of registers? Would it be better to use just one set of general purpose registers? For example, we could have instructions such as:

    ```
    add R1, R2, R3
    fadd R1, R2, R3
    ```

    Although these are different types of instructions, they could use the same general purpose register. Assume that we have two different architectures (1) unified register file architecture that has 2N registers and (2) separate register file architecture that has N general purpose registers and N floating-point registers. Please answer the following question:

    8.1 What changes are required in the ISA to support the unified register file? Are these changes better or worse than the separate register file architecture?

    > Architecture with shared registers can store more temporaries in registers, which decrease the time to store/load the value to/from memory.

    8.2 How would the unified register file affect the performance? Please explain the advantage and the disadvantage of the proposed change.

    > ChatGPT: Modern ISAs typically provide separate sets of registers for general purpose and floating-point operations due to several reasons:
    >
    > Data Types: General purpose registers store integer data, while floating-point registers store floating-point (decimal) data. These data types have different representations and require specialized arithmetic operations. By having separate register files, processors can optimize these operations for their respective data types, improving efficiency.
    >
    > Parallelism: Many modern processors are designed for parallel execution of instructions. By having separate register files, the processor can execute a general-purpose instruction and a floating-point instruction simultaneously, exploiting instruction-level parallelism.
    >
    > Specialized Hardware: Floating-point arithmetic often requires specialized hardware, like floating-point units (FPUs), which are optimized for floating-point calculations. By having dedicated floating-point registers, these units can operate efficiently without contention from general purpose operations.
    >
    > Performance: Separating register files allows for better pipelining and scheduling of instructions. Instructions from both types can be executed in parallel without contention, leading to faster overall execution for mixed-type programs.
    >
    > Simplicity: Having separate register files simplifies the design and control of the processor. Complexities arising from handling different data types in a single register file, such as type checking and data conversion, are avoided.
    >
    > Compiler Optimization: Compilers can better optimize code when they know which registers are designated for specific data types. This knowledge enables them to generate more efficient code sequences.
    >
    > While a unified register file could simplify the design, it might lead to complications in handling different data types efficiently and in parallel. It could also result in increased complexity for the hardware and the compiler, potentially negating the simplification benefits. Therefore, the separation of general purpose and floating-point registers in modern ISAs strikes a balance between efficiency, performance, and simplicity, catering to the diverse requirements of various computational tasks.

9. Consider the single-cycle RISC-V CPU shown in Figure 1. Please answer true or false for each of the following statements. Note that you must point out why the statement is wrong if you answer false.

    9.1 If the path from `rs2` port in the register file to the `rd` in data memory has been cut, the instruction `add`, `slt`, and `sw` still can run correctly.

    > Incorrect. Instruction `add` depends on `rs2`, cutting path leads incorrect result.

    9.2 If the path from `ImmGen` to `Shift left 1` has been remove, the instructions `lw`, `sw` and `beq` may fail.

    > Incorrect. Instruction `beq` does not depends on `shift left 1`

    9.3 If the control signal ALUsrc is stuck on 0, the instruction `lw`, `sw`, and `beq` may fail to run correctly.

    > Incorrect. Instruction `beq` accepts 2 operands from register, which expected that control signal ALUsrc is set as 0.

    9.4 If the control signal RegWrite is stuck on 0, the instructions `lw` and `sw` still can run correctly.

    > Correct.

    9.5 If the control signal MemToReg is stuck on 1, the instructions `add`, `sub`, `lw` and `slt` may fail to run correctly.

    > Incorrect. Instruction `lw` may run correctly.

10. Consider the single-cycle CPU architecture in Figure 1. The latency of each block is given in the following. Assume that the hardware module has zero delays if not specified.

    | I-Mem |  Add  |  Mux  |  ALU  | Regs  | D-Mem | ImmGen | Shift-left-1 |
    | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :----: | :----------: |
    |  200  |  50   |  20   |  120  |  80   |  250  |   20   |      10      |

    ```
    1020        sub  $s4, $s3, $t3
    1024        beq  $t2, $s4, Else
    1028        addi $t2, $t2, -4
    1032        add  $t0, $t1, $t2
    1036        sw   $s2, 0($t0)
        ...
    1088 Else:  addi $t2, $t2, 4
    ```

    10.1 Suppose now the processor only needs to support instructions shown above. Please calculate the latency of the critical path for each instruction.

    10.2 What would the cycle time be?

    > Equals to the highest latency among all supported instructions.

    10.3 Before this code segment, the register contents in decimal are given as follows. After execution, for some clock cycles, if X=1028, what are the values of signal Y (after the MUX controlled by ALUsrc) and signal Z (input of PC)

11. A new S-type format instruction `swu` has been added to the RISC-V instruction set. Its format `swu rs2, 1(rs1)`. It takes arguments register rs2, register rs1, and immediate 1, and it stores the contents of `R[rs2]` at the memory address (`R[rs1]+1`)

    11.1 Given the single-cycle datapath in Figure 1, fill in the control signals in the table below for this new instruction. Each control signal must be specified as 0, 1, or X (don't care), ('add', 'sub', 'mul', ... for ALUOp). Writing a 0 or 1 when an X is more accurate is incorrect.

    | RegWrite | ALUSrc | ALUOp | MemWrite | MemRead | MemtoReg | PCSrc |
    | :------: | :----: | :---: | :------: | :-----: | :------: | :---: |
    |    0     |   1    |  Add  |    1     |    x    |    x     |   ?   |

    11.2 Now one more new I-type format instruction `jin imm12(rs1)` is developed for the single-cycle processor, which is a Jump Indirect instruction and will cause the processor to jump to the address stored in the word at memory location `imm12 + R[rs1]` (the same address computed by `lw`). Draw the necessary modifications to implement the `jin` instruction directly on Figure in your question sheet.
